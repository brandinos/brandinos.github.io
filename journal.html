      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As I was looking for a way to keep a log aka journal to keep track of
        stuff that is happening in my life, I looked it up on the internet of
        how to do this. I previously kept track of my journal on the NoFap
        forum, but that didn't quite work well for me. As I read a lot of books,
        I came to sense that, if you open the ebook file, it is just plain text
        in HTML, styled with CSS. This lighted a light bulb in my mind. As I am
        interested in web development, (and I do a study for that too), i
        thought: 'why not make an HTML ebook, where i keep track of my life?'
        This is that ebbook, or in this case Webbook.

        Even though I went on the dopamine detox challenge, I keep failing by
        either listening to music or playing some game. I did not expect this to
        be this hard. In short, a dopamine detox is 30 days or more doing no
        music, games, social media, movies and series, tv, wit as addition
        adding good habits like reading or journaling.

        <br />

        Cutting out social media and tv is quite easy for me. I can manage to do
        that for long extended periods. No problem. But, quitting games, is a
        story apart. I play the game World of Tanks since late 2013, being very
        skilled at it. As the years passed, the game went from good to worse to
        bad. That time is now. The game is highly addictive and frustrating. I
        have tried to quit it several times by deleting the games out and
        removing it from my computer. Even that does not help to quit this
        highly addicting game. For my own sake and for the sake of my
        productivity, I need to cut this piece of shit out of my life. I think
        this part will be mostly sheer will power.

        <br />

        Other than that, I'm quite able to do it for a long. The reason why I do
        this detox is to enjoy the little things again. Being hooked to
        artificial supernormal stimulus isn't a thing our primitive brains were
        made for. A 9-hour world of tanks session fueled by monster energy and
        sugar-rich food gives such a high dopamine kick, that you want more and
        more of it to feel better. This reason alone is enough to quit. Like our
        ancestors had this, right? They had to enjoy the 'little things, such as
        watching a sky filled with stars galaxies and what more, imaging if
        there was someone out there.

        <br />

        Also, I do hope that I get so bored that I am forced to do something. I
        do nothing for an hour, and suddenly, I am doing my homework. Not to
        talk about the huge free time you get by going on a dopamine detox. Most
        people watch a lot of movies or game a lot. By quitting those two, a
        humungus amount of free time suddenly knocks on one door. But what
        matters most is what i do with all this newly created time. Do I either
        waste it on searching for love? or do I do something which will benefit
        me, like writing this journal? Time, that is what matters most. Do not
        waste it, before you know it, you have run out of it.
